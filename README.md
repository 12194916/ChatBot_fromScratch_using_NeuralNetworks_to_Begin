#        AI_ChatBots_by_Me
   We will start building  AI chatbots, from simple one to advanced.  

    1.It is simple code that can be used for chatbots. The tags in json file are the classes for classification, 
    patterns are text data for each class, and the answer is something that works after training. The model will 
    do classification for patterns, so that it will detect the question class. Accordingly, the answer is given. 
    This is what is inside the hugging face models. To understand how gpt works we should understand that code. 
    You may use LSTM,RNN or GRU for the model. I just used ANN as my purpose is not built chatbot with it, but to 
    undestand how the AI, behind chatbots works.
